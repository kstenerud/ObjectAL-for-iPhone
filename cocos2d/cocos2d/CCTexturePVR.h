/** CCTexturePVR

 Object that loads PVR images.

 Supported PVR formats:
	- RGBA8888
	- BGRA8888
	- RGBA4444
	- RGBA5551
	- RGB565
	- A8
	- I8
	- AI88
	- PVRTC 4BPP
	- PVRTC 2BPP

 Limitations:
	Pre-generated mipmaps, such as PVR textures with mipmap levels embedded in file,
	are only supported if all individual sprites are of _square_ size.
	To use mipmaps with non-square textures, instead call CCTexture2D#generateMipmap on the sheet texture itself
	(and to save space, save the PVR sprite sheet without mip maps included).
