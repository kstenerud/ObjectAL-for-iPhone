@class CCSprite;

/** CCSpriteBatchNode is like a batch node: if it contains children, it will draw them in 1 single OpenGL call
 * (often known as "batch draw").
 *
 * A CCSpriteBatchNode can reference one and only one texture (one image file, one texture atlas).
 * Only the CCSprites that are contained in that texture can be added to the CCSpriteBatchNode.
 * All CCSprites added to a CCSpriteBatchNode are drawn in one OpenGL ES draw call.
 * If the CCSprites are not added to a CCSpriteBatchNode then an OpenGL ES draw call will be needed for each one, which is less efficient.
 *
 *
 * Limitations:
 *  - The only object that is accepted as child (or grandchild, grand-grandchild, etc...) is CCSprite or any subclass of CCSprite. eg: particles, labels and layer can't be added to a CCSpriteBatchNode.
 *  - Either all its children are Aliased or Antialiased. It can't be a mix. This is because "alias" is a property of the texture, and all the sprites share the same texture.
 *
