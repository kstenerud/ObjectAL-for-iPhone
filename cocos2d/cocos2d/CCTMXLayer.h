/** CCTMXLayer represents the TMX layer.

 It is a subclass of CCSpriteBatchNode. By default the tiles are rendered using a CCTextureAtlas.
 If you mofify a tile on runtime, then, that tile will become a CCSprite, otherwise no CCSprite objects are created.
 The benefits of using CCSprite objects as tiles are:
 - tiles (CCSprite) can be rotated/scaled/moved with a nice API

 cocos2d v2.0 doesn't support the cc_vertexz value. Whenever a the cc_vertexz property is found, it will raise an exception.

 "value" by default is 0, but you can change it from Tiled by adding the "cc_alpha_func" property to the layer.
 The value 0 should work for most cases, but if you have tiles that are semi-transparent, then you might want to use a differnt
 value, like 0.5.

 For further information, please see the programming guide:

	http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/prog_guide:tiled_maps

 @since v0.8.1
 
 Tiles can have tile flags for additional properties. At the moment only flip horizontal and flip vertical are used. These bit flags are defined in CCTMXXMLParser.h.
 
 @since 1.1
