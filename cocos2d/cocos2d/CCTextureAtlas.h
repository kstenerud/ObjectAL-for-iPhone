/** A class that implements a Texture Atlas.
 Supported features:
   * The atlas file can be a PVRTC, PNG or any other fomrat supported by Texture2D
   * Quads can be udpated in runtime
   * Quads can be added in runtime
   * Quads can be removed in runtime
   * Quads can be re-ordered in runtime
   * The TextureAtlas capacity can be increased or decreased in runtime
   * OpenGL component: V3F, C4B, T2F.
 The quads are rendered using an OpenGL ES VBO.
 To render the quads using an interleaved vertex array list, you should modify the ccConfig.h file
