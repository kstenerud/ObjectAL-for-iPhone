/**
 * A simpler interface to the ObjectAL sound library. This singleton can be
 * used alone for simpler audio needs, or in conjunction with user-created
 * audio objects for more advanced needs (as is done in many of the demos).
 *
 * For sound effects, it initializes OpenAL with the default ALDevice,
 * an ALContext, and an ALChannelSource consisting of all 32 interruptible
 * ALSource objects (the maximum currently allowed for iOS).
 * If you want to create your own sources as well, change the reservedSources
 * property.
 *
 * For background audio, it creates a single OALAudioTrack, which will not reserve
 * resources unless used. (you can create more OALAudioTrack objects for your own
 * use if you want).
 *
 * This singleton also provides access to the more common configuration options
 * available in OALAudioSupport.
 *
 * All audio playback commands are delegated either to the ALChannelSource
 * (for sound effects), or to the OALAudioTrack (for BG music).
